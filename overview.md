Arthur Whitney developed the q programming language and its database kdb+. Released by Kx Systems, Inc. in 2003, the primary design objectives of q are expressiveness, speed and efficiency.

*Evaluation Order*:  While q is entered left-to-right, expressions are evaluated right-to-left or, as the q gods prefer, left of right â€“ meaning that a function is applied to the argument on its right. There is no operator precedence and function application can be written without brackets. Punctuation noise is significantly reduced.
